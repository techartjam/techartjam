        <title>Ideas are cheap</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;ideas-are-cheap&quot;&gt;Ideas are cheap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once told an animator that &lt;em&gt;ideas are cheap&lt;/em&gt;. He was offended as he thought I said his ideas weren’t good. At the time, he was working with a “difficult” group of designers who didn’t like input on anything from anyone who was not on their team.  So maybe he was sensitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was coaching him on the fact that anyone can create ideas easily. It’s the execution of the idea that is hard. Ever seen a product or service and though to yourself “that was my idea”? We’ve all had a bunch of those. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validating the idea and building it is the hard part. I went on to tell him that he needs to come up with the ideas, and then add notes to how &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt; they might be. Nothing formal, just a “risk assessment” or pre-mortem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the checklist I gave him: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a list of ideas. The more the better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think of as many ways as you can for why each idea might fail. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then for the ideas without fail states, make a note for how long the idea will take to implement. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666&quot;&gt;The Dip&lt;/a&gt; is a good, brief book on evaluating the amount of work required to execute something, and ultimately if it’s worth it at all. &lt;/p&gt;
