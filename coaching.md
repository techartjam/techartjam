**I work best by helping people do their best work**.

I have spent two decades working with Engineers, Artists and Designers. My roles have always focused on building bridges between silos. I believe that _All arts and sciences are branches of the same tree_.

I offer insight on how to take your creativity to levels you've never even imagined. I can help make technology transparent, so you can focus on doing what you do best. 

I only take clients via invite or referrals at this time.
