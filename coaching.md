**I work best by helping people do their best work**.

I have spent two decades working with Engineers, Artists and Designers. My roles have always focused on building bridges between silos. I believe that _All arts and sciences are branches of the same tree_.

My strength is helping people be better at what they're already good at. I listen more than I talk. When I do talk it will be to ask you questions. You may not like the questions at first, but they come from a place of empathy and caring. The questions are always designed to move you forward. Sometimes that means looking into your past, or the places you'd like to avoid. 

I do this kind of coaching to help people, and to build my own strengths as a coach. 

I only take clients via invite or referrals at this time. However, I am always happy to start talking via [email](mailto:chad@techartjam.com).
