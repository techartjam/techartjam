Hi, I'm Chad. 

I'm a Senior Technical Project Manager at [Mad*Pow](http://www.madpow.com) and co-founder of [Rigging Dojo](http://riggingdojo.com). I've been working with creative and technical people for 20 years. Someone once said that _I work best by helping people do their best work_.

My work has always included helping individuals and teams work across silos. I'm good at helping creative people understand technology, and technologists understand creativity.   

Please say [hello](mailto:chad@techartjam.com) if you want to chat.
