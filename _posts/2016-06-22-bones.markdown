"I don't have a creative bone in my body", he said. 

"Sure you do, everyone does," I thought.  "Maybe you just haven't been cut deep enough or broken the right bones to find them."

Then I reflected on my thoughts. They were poorly constructed for two reasons. 

**We don't know each others wounds.** 

We don't go around showing our emotional scars too often. They do manifest in behavior of course. But we tend not to outright say what's happened to us. Who am I to judge anyway.

**You don't have to _suffer_ to be an artist.** 

You have to be connected to your world through your experiences, and filter all that through your unique expression. However, you can mine the well of positivity just as deeply as negativity.  

The next time someone says "I don't have a creative bone in my body", I won't rush to judge. Maybe I can find a way to encourage them to see where these bones are.
