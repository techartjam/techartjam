I had another [Broken Record](http://blog.chadgmoore.com/broken-records) conversation with my son this evening. I was hasty and a little harsh. During our conversation, my son asked me a question that gave me pause. He basically asked me _What problem are we trying to solve?_ 

He used one of my favorite tactics. That question really gives all parties in a discussion a chance to pause, and turn down whatever heat is being generated due to miscommunication. It also gives all the parties a chance to align to move forward.  

**I'm starting to better understand my children's strengths.**

Seems like my son is very fact and detail driven. Perhaps I am more emotionally driven. Maybe I want to tell a story too much or prove a point to impart wisdom. He just wants facts.

The next time we spin the broken record, I'll just deliver the facts, and we will see where it goes.
