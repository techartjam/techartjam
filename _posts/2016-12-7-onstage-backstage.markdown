I heard a recent episode of the always solid [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w/299) podcast recently. In which Merlin Mann relayed a phrase he heard from the novelist [Patrick Rothfuss](http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/). Rothfuss is the author of [The Kingkiller Chronicle](https://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Patrick-Rothfuss/dp/0756404746). Rothfuss takes a lot of abuse online as the third book in the trilogy has been in the works for years. Book two, The Wise Man's Fear came out in 2013. 

Allegedly Book 3 is "done" and in a state of editing. People seem pissed off about that. So this quote has some personal background for Rothfuss, I am sure.

He said (paraphrased): 

> Don't compare your backstage to their onstage.

We usually only see the person's work as it launches, gets released or published. We don't see the _hours_ of hard work that went into the work. A lot of people and places online will try to sell you the 3 easy steps to drawing, making games, blogging, etc. 

**There are three steps, but it turns out that they aren't easy.**

To make a thing, follow these time consuming, islolating and nerve racking steps:

1. Isolate yourself so you can focus
2. Do the work
3. Get feedback, and repeat

That's it. That's the _backstage_ that so many people selling us things gloss over, or try to make glossy. 

**Do the work.**
