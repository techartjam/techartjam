I just booked my first E6W. I am _so_ excited. E6W is "Every six weeks". Not sure if it was "invented" by [Merlin Mann](https://twitter.com/@hotdogsladies) or popularized by him. Anyway, I heard it on [Back to Work](5by5.yv/b2w) ages ago, and have finally A) Found the time to do this and B) gotten over the irrational fear of possibly losing the respect of the people I admire by inviting them to this crazy thing. 

Here's how it works, it's simple, really. Schedule a call with a person you admire, and always have had great conversations with. Have a call once every six weeks. Talk about anything and everything. That's it.

The frequency of the past conversations doesn't really matter. Here's part of my email I sent for the invites:

> Sometimes we talk often, sometimes not for months. Every time we do talk, we donâ€™t miss a beat and pick up right where we left off. 

The goals are to connect and converse on a deeper level than social media and txt provides. 

There's a great write up over at [Tech and Coffee](http://techandcoffee.com/blog/e6w), if you want more info.

My goals with this are to grow as a conversationalist, catch up with people I admire and learn from them. Looking forward to it.
