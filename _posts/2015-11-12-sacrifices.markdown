<blockquote>
  <p>Man sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. Then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; He lives as though he is never going to die and dies never really having lived. <br />
- Dalai Lama</p>
    </blockquote>

<p>Something to reread when I'm looking to be more mindful of the now.</p>
