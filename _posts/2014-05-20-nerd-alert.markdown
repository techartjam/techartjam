<p>Ever since delicious shut down I’ve been missing a good web bookmark service. I recently heard of <a href="http://saved.io">saved.io</a> on lifehacker and thought I’d give it a try. I've been using <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> which is awesome for storing longer articles to read at a later time. While the saving and reading experience in Instapaper are top notch, it doesn't feel like a bookmarking service to me. Instapaper is for reading, and saved.io is for bookmarking sites I want to explore.</p>

<p>Saved.io is a very simple service, which I like. There's a browser extension for chrome and a bookmarklet. But there's a better way to get a page added to your list. You simple type <code>saved.io/</code> in front of the url.</p>

<p>You can also add lists by typing their names too, so just put <code>myList.saved.io/</code> in front of he URL. This will add the bookmark to the myList list. Neat.</p>

<p>There is no social sharing, as there are a million ways to share links these days and just tweeting them seems to work best.</p>

<p>My one slight compalint on saved.io is that after creating the bookmark, it takes you to the bookmarks page. I think I'd rather it keep me on the page I just bookmarked.</p>

<p>While I did install the chrome extension, I've been playing with the typing functionality more. Which leads me to something else. I've set up a text expansion snippet in <a href="https://www.trankynam.com/atext/">aText</a>, a 5$ app. Text expansion snippets allow you to type something short, and have much longer (and formatted) text appear. <br />
For example if I type <code>;bm</code> the text 'saved.io/' is displayed. So all I have to do is type ;bm in front of the url I'm browsing to save the bookmark.</p>

<p>Does text expansion seem unnecessary? I thought so too at first. Then I tried it and I realized just how many times a day I was typing the same thing, again and again. Try a demo of a text expansion app (aText has a free demo and there are lot's of others for windows and mac alike) and just start with a snippet for your email address. If it makes sense to your brain, add more snippets.</p>

<p>Try it, you'll be surprised at A) how much time you save over the course of a day and B) how much stuff you can unload out of your mind so you can the big stuff into your thoughts.</p>

<p>I've got all my emails, phone numbers, signatures, and addresses as snippets. Also I have form letters, FAQ responses and a bunch of other things. It's a big time saver.</p>

<p>Here's a demo of the aText and saved.io functionality.</p>
