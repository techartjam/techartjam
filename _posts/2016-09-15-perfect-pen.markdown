description: "stopping myself from stopping myself"
---

I spent time on learning and trying a new tool. This consisted of reading articles, downloading and figuring out trial software. 

I stopped, went outside and thought about what problem I was really trying to solve. So, turns out, I didn't need to solve it. I can do most of the things I need to do without the tool. The ones that I can't, well turns out that it turns out, they aren't important anyway. 

So I saved some money, and some time. More so, I also stopped distracting myself from doing the work.

**I stopped trying to find the perfect pen, and started writing.** Figuratively Speaking.
