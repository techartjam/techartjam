Have you ever been at work and had a moment or two "nothing to do"? I had a moment like that today.

I realized that I was ignoring important but not urgent work. I could have started those documents I owe next week, but there wasn’t urgency, so I delayed.

So I fell into the twitter, reddit, newsreader circle. I even signed up for an open source twitter alternative after I read that latest “why I left twitter article”.

I couldn’t think of what to write, or do at the time, so I read the internet via those sites. Over and over. **The streams are always running.**

So, once I caught up with one stream, I jumped to the other until I was caught up, then the other, then back again to the first. This is a pretty great way to waste time. I’m not focusing when I do this. I skim. Find a link to read and skim it. If it’s too long, bookmark it to never read it later.

Leo’s point in the “Finding Stillness & Meaning “ portion of his [Noise](https://zenhabits.net/noise) article hit me.

When I have these idle moments of time wasting, I will indeed ask myself this question to spur appreciation for all that I have, verses what I do _not_. And drive me towards ideas and more importantly, execution.
